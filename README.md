## Features

- **Trail Location Sharing**: Automatically updates your friends when you're active on the trail and shares your real-time location with them, limited strictly to trail usage.
- **Do Not Disturb Mode**: Provides full control over your visibility on the trail.
- **Augmented Reality Enhancements**: Leverages Swift for seamless AR integrations, enabling immersive interactions as you navigate the trail.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Location sharing is trail-specific, with additional privacy settings to ensure users control their visibility.


## Technical Overview

- **CoreLocation**: Manages real-time trail-specific location sharing, with careful handling of background updates to balance accuracy and battery efficiency.
